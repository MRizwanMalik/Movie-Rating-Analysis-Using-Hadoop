## 📋 Introduction  

This project demonstrates how to analyze movie rating datasets using Hadoop’s **MapReduce** programming paradigm. It processes massive datasets in a distributed manner, enabling efficient computation of:  
- 📈 Average ratings per movie  
- 📊 Number of ratings per movie

## 🗂️ Project Structure  

```plaintext
.
├── combiner.py           # Optional combiner function to pre-aggregate key-value pairs
├── mapper.py             # Mapper function to parse data and generate key-value pairs
├── reducer.py            # Reducer function to aggregate data and compute results
├── runhadoop.sh          # Shell script to execute the MapReduce job on a Hadoop cluster
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```  

- **`combiner.py`**: Implements the optional combiner to pre-aggregate intermediate results on mapper nodes.  
- **`mapper.py`**: Defines the mapper logic to parse input data and emit key-value pairs.  
- **`reducer.py`**: Implements the reducer logic to process mapper output and generate final results.  
- **`runhadoop.sh`**: A customizable script to execute the MapReduce job on your Hadoop setup.

## ⚙️ Requirements  

- **Apache Hadoop**: [Download Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html)  
- **Python**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (ensure compatibility with your Hadoop installation)

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the Repository  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MRizwanMalik/movie-rating-analysis.git
cd movie-rating-analysis
```  

### 2. Install Dependencies  

Ensure Hadoop and Python are properly installed on your system or cluster.  

### 3. Configure `runhadoop.sh`  

Edit `runhadoop.sh` and set the following variables:  

- **`INPUT_PATH`**: Path to your movie rating data file(s) in HDFS.  
- **`OUTPUT_PATH`**: Path to the HDFS directory where results will be stored.  

### 4. Run the Analysis  

Navigate to the project directory and execute the script:  

```bash
sh runhadoop.sh
```  

---

## 📊 Output  

The analysis results will be stored in the specified **`OUTPUT_PATH`** in HDFS. The output format depends on the logic in `mapper.py` and `reducer.py`, such as:  

- **Average Rating per Movie**  
- **Number of Ratings per Movie**
